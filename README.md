Optimal Scaling for Random Walk Metropolis-Hastings (RWM) Algorithm with Generalized Normal Distribution

Overview: This repository contains Python code to run the RWM algorithm for a high-dimensional generalized normal distribution. The code is used to study the impact of proposal scale on the performance of MCMC in terms of acceptance rate, Expected Squared Jump Distance (ESJD), and convergence across parallel chains.
